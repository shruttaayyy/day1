**#Ques:** Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. <br/> e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8 <br/>
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ") <br/>
name = two_digit_number  <br/>
print(int(name[0]) + int (name[1])) <br/>

**Notes: <br/>**
1. Order of priority - **PEMDAS** (LR)
between M and D, A and S - the one at the left is given more priority 
2. round(number, number of decimal places) 
3. f-string <br/>
Eg: print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {}") where score and height within the brackets are already defined <br/>
4. modulo is written as a percentage sign -  gives you the remainder after a division.<br/>
